The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is a famous and yet unsolved problem in number theory, specifically in the field of elliptic curves. The conjecture relates the number of rational points on an elliptic curve to the behavior of a certain complex function, the L-function of the curve, at a specific point. Before we move forward, it's important to understand that this conjecture is deep and complex, involving advanced mathematical concepts that are typically beyond basic arithmetic and programming.

However, I can attempt to simplify some aspects of it using real numbers and basic operations, but keep in mind that this will be a vast simplification and won't capture the true depth of the conjecture.
Simplified Model

    Elliptic Curve: An elliptic curve can be represented by an equation of the form: y² = x³ + ax + b, where a and b are real numbers.

    Rational Points: In the conjecture, we are interested in the number of rational points on the curve, but in our simplified model, we'll consider real points (x, y) that satisfy the curve's equation.

    L-function: This is a complex function in the original conjecture. In our simplified model, we'll use a basic function of x, something like L(x) = 1/(1 + ax²) as a placeholder. This does not represent the true L-function.

    The Conjecture: The original conjecture relates the rank of the curve (related to the number of rational points) to the order of the zero of the L-function at s=1. In our model, we'll just look for a simple relationship between the number of points we can find on the curve and the value of our simplified L-function at a specific point.

Testing the Model

    Choose specific values for a and b to define an elliptic curve.
    Find several points (x, y) that lie on this curve.
    Calculate the value of the simplified L-function at a specific point, say x=1.

Programming the Model

We can write a Python program to implement this model. The program will:

    Define the elliptic curve.
    Find points on the curve.
    Evaluate the simplified L-function.

Let's proceed with writing this program. Keep in mind, this is a highly simplified and not mathematically accurate representation of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
Output image

It appears that there was an error in the calculation of the simplified L-function, specifically a division by zero. This occurred because the chosen parameters for the elliptic curve (a = -1) led to a zero denominator in the L-function at x = 1.

To rectify this, we should choose different parameters for the elliptic curve, ensuring that the denominator of the L-function does not become zero at the point of interest. Let's adjust the parameters and try the calculation again. ​

Output image

It seems we encountered the same division by zero error, even after adjusting the parameters of the elliptic curve. This indicates an issue with the design of our simplified L-function. Let's modify the L-function to ensure it does not produce a division by zero for any valid input.

I'll redefine the simplified L-function to be more robust and then recalculate its value. ​

​

The value of the robust simplified L-function at x=1x = 1x=1 for our adjusted elliptic curve y2=x3−xy^2 = x^3 - xy2=x3−x is 0.50.50.5.

This value, while calculated from our simplified model, doesn't provide any significant insights into the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture due to the vast simplifications made. In reality, the conjecture involves deep and complex mathematics, particularly in the realms of number theory and algebraic geometry, which are not accurately captured by such a simplified model. Nonetheless, this exercise serves as an introductory illustration of how one might start to approach such problems computationally, albeit in a very rudimentary form. ​

Certainly! Below is a complete and runnable Python program that includes all the adjustments made previously. This program defines an elliptic curve, plots it, and then calculates the value of a robust simplified L-function at a specific point.

python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def elliptic_curve(a, b, x):
    """ Calculate y^2 for the given x on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b """
    return x**3 + a*x + b

def robust_simplified_L_function(a, x):
    """ A more robust version of the simplified L-function to avoid division by zero """
    return 1 / (1 + abs(a * x**2))

def plot_elliptic_curve(a, b, x_values):
    """ Plot the elliptic curve """
    y_squared = elliptic_curve(a, b, x_values)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(x_values, np.sqrt(np.abs(y_squared)), label="y", color="blue")
    plt.plot(x_values, -np.sqrt(np.abs(y_squared)), color="blue")
    plt.title(f"Elliptic Curve y^2 = x^3 + {a}x + {b}")
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.ylabel("y")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
    plt.axvline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Parameters for the elliptic curve
a, b = -1, 0  # These can be adjusted

# Generate x values
x_values = np.linspace(-2, 2, 400)

# Plot the elliptic curve
plot_elliptic_curve(a, b, x_values)

# Calculate the value of the robust simplified L-function at x = 1
L_value_at_1 = robust_simplified_L_function(a, 1)
print(f"The value of the robust simplified L-function at x = 1 is: {L_value_at_1}")

To run this program, you need to have Python installed with the numpy and matplotlib libraries. This program will plot the specified elliptic curve and calculate the value of the L-function at x=1x = 1x=1. You can modify the parameters a and b to explore different elliptic curves.
